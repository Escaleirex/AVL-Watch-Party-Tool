# AVL Watch Party Tool
I made this simple website to help me and others watch AfreecaTV Valorant League or AVL Watch Parties.

# WARNING
This repository is outdated (and yes its still terrible code, i'm not proud of it), while yes, it still works, this was probably a one time thing with AfreecaTV and as we have seen in 2024, theres other streaming services that made tournaments like SOOP and i honestly lost interest in valorant so i'll credit the fork that exists of the time i'm writing this (18/12/2024) for SOOP. please go check em out:

# How to Use
Access the [Link](https://escaleirex.github.io/AVL-Watch-Party-Tool/Chat) and Watch!
(By Default it goes to sliggy's stream, but you can change it on the bottom right.)

# Disclaimer
This is really bad code, i made this in 2 hours.
The website has some issues that i might fix later.
